The Adapter design pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. This design pattern lets classes work together that couldn‘t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.
