The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing a shared resource or configuration settings.

Key features of the Singleton pattern include:

1- Private Constructor: The class's constructor is made private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.

2- Static Instance: The class itself contains a static member that holds the reference to the single instance that it creates.

3- Lazy Instantiation (Optional): The instance is created only when it's requested for the first time, rather than eagerly at the application's startup.

4- Global Access Point: The Singleton instance is typically accessed via a static method that returns the same instance every time it's called.

5- Thread Safety (Optional): In multithreaded environments, precautions may need to be taken to ensure that the Singleton instance is created atomically and that multiple threads don't inadvertently create separate instances.
