Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
	A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
	This principle advocates for designing classes that have a single purpose or responsibility. It promotes cohesion and reduces 	coupling, making classes easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
