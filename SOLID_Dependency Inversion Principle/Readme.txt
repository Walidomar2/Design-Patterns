Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
	High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
	This principle advocates for decoupling modules by introducing an abstraction layer between high-level and low-level modules. By 	depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, code becomes more flexible, reusable, and easier to test and 	maintain.
