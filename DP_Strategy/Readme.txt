Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.

the components involved in the Strategy Design Pattern:

1- Context: This is the class that has a reference to the strategy interface. It's the class that will use the algorithm.

2- Strategy Interface: This is an interface or abstract class that defines the method(s) to be implemented by concrete strategies. It declares the method(s) that will be used by the context class.

3- Concrete Strategies: These are the actual implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy implements a specific algorithm.

When should you use the Strategy Pattern?

1- When you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list.
2- When you need to use one of several algorithms dynamically.
3- When you have a class that has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.
4- When you want to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures to the client.

Advantages of using the Strategy Pattern:

1- Improved Flexibility: You can easily swap algorithms at runtime.
2- Enhanced Readability: It separates the code related to the algorithm from the context, making both easier to understand and maintain.
3- Promotes Code Reusability: Algorithms can be reused among different contexts.
4- Easier Testing: Testing strategies in isolation is simpler compared to testing a monolithic class with multiple algorithms.
