Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
	Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
	This principle emphasizes the importance of designing fine-grained, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. By 	doing so, classes and modules are not burdened with dependencies on methods they don't need, promoting better code 	maintainability and flexibility.
